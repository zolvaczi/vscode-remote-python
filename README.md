# Try Out Development Containers: Python

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section. 

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "Python" sample, wait for the container to start and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem.   

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally. 

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `app.py`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.

2. **Terminal:** 
    - Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> to open a terminal window.
    - Type `python -m flask run --port 9000 --no-debugger --no-reload` to run the app.
    - Open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:9000` to see the running app.
    
      > **Tip:** If you use this container outside of VS Code via `docker run` with `-p 9000`, you may need to append `--host 0.0.0.0` to the command above. The `-p` option "publishes" the port rather than forwarding it. It therefore will not work if the application only listens to localhost. The `forwardPorts` property in `devcontainer.json` does not have this limitation, but you can use `appPort` property instead if you want to mirror the `docker run` behavior.

3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `app.py`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 9).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables (e.g. the app variable on line 7), examining locals, and more.
   - Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:9000` and note you can connect to the server in the container

4. **Forward another port:**
   - Stop debugging and remove the breakpoint.
   - Open `.vscode/launch.json`
   - Change the server port to 5000 on line 20. (`"--port","5000"`)
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Forward a Port** command.
   - Select port 5000.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.

5. **Run from the command line**
    - Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> to open a terminal window
